ThreadLocal

一开始看ThreadLocal的initialValue()方法时，不太懂直接附了null值作为初始值或者说感觉有什么深意，其实本身并没有意义只是为了用于子类可以通过覆盖该方法进行初始值的变更，以下是JDK的源码注解：
```
    /**
     * Returns the current thread's "initial value" for this
     * thread-local variable.  This method will be invoked the first
     * time a thread accesses the variable with the {@link #get}
     * method, unless the thread previously invoked the {@link #set}
     * method, in which case the {@code initialValue} method will not
     * be invoked for the thread.  Normally, this method is invoked at
     * most once per thread, but it may be invoked again in case of
     * subsequent invocations of {@link #remove} followed by {@link #get}.
     *
     * <p>This implementation simply returns {@code null}; if the
     * programmer desires thread-local variables to have an initial
     * value other than {@code null}, {@code ThreadLocal} must be
     * subclassed, and this method overridden.  Typically, an
     * anonymous inner class will be used.
     *
     * @return the initial value for this thread-local
     */
